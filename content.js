I moved to Bella Coola because I believe in small communities and the businesses that power them. I built this service because I saw too many small business owners drowning in admin work that could be automated — and because I wanted to offer something practical, not another AI sales pitch.",

                question: "I'm not technical — will I be able to use this?",
                answer: "Yes. I build systems that work in the background or through simple interfaces (like text messages or dashboards). You don't need to understand the tech — you just need to use the results. I also provide training and documentation in plain English."
            },
            {
                question: "Do I need a new website?",
                answer: "No. Most systems integrate with what you already have — your email, phone, social media, and calendar. If your website is outdated, I'll let you know, but it's not a requirement to get started."

            {
                question: "Will AI systems replace my staff?",
                answer: "No. These systems remove tedious tasks like data entry, follow-ups, and reporting — freeing your team (or you) to focus on higher-value work like customer relationships, strategy, and growth. AI systems serve people, not replace them."
            },
            {
                question: "How much does this cost?",
                answer: "The Business Audit is the first step and is free or low-cost depending on scope. Pilot systems typically range from $1,500–$3,500 depending on complexity. Full AI operations support is custom-priced based on your needs. I'll always give you clear pricing before we start work."

                question: "What if I'm skeptical?",
                answer: "Good. You should be. That's why we start with the audit — a low-risk, no-obligation session where we map your operations and see if automation makes sense for you. If it doesn't, I'll tell you. If it does, you'll have a clear plan and can decide from there."

            {
                question: "Will this work for my industry?",
                answer: "Probably. I've built systems for trades, tourism, restaurants, retail, and more. The principles are the same: capture leads, follow up, automate repetitive tasks, and give you insights. If your industry has unique challenges, we'll address them in the audit."
            },

                question: "Is my data safe?",

            {
                question: "What happens if something breaks?",
                answer: "I provide support and monitoring for all systems I build. If you're in the Bella Coola Valley, you get lifetime technician availability — meaning I'm here to diagnose and fix issues as they come up. For remote clients, I offer support packages. Important clarification: lifetime technician availability means you have priority access to me for diagnostics, troubleshooting, and fixes. It does not mean unlimited free work — if a fix requires significant new development or integration, I'll give you clear pricing upfront. Think of it like having a trusted mechanic on call: I'm here to help, and I'll always be fair and transparent about costs."
